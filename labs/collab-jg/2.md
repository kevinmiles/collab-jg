## Step 2: Place the Jabber Guest URL into the site code

> Jabber Guest client URL

```javascript
window.open('https://jabberguestsandbox.cisco.com/call/5555','popup','width=550,height=400,toolbar=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no')
```

Now, let's modify the `onclick` attribute of the `<input>` element so that the 'Chat Now!' button opens a Jabber Guest voice and video session popup window:

1. Use the keyboard/mouse to copy the Jabber Guest URL configured for access to the local Jabber Guest server (see the URL/code listed above)

2. Paste the code into the edit window, exactly between the two double-quotes following the `onclick` attribute: `onclick="<paste-code-here>"`.
```
<input value="Chat Now!" type="submit" onclick=" ">
```

3. Left-click anywhere outside the code edit window to save the changes, and close the developer tools window (press `F12`)
