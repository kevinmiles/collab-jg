# Jabber Guest - Embedded Browser Video Calling

## Objective

Use the Jabber Guest API to embed consumer-to-business video calling directly into an existing live web site

## Overview

Cisco Jabber Guest provides developers with the ability to easily embed live video calling directly into internet browser applications and mobile apps (Android/iOS,) giving customers seamless, secure, high-quality access to your enterprise experts or call center inside the firewall.  The Jabber Guest web client is implemented as an HTML/Javascript 'widget', which installs/launches a small plug-in and UI to handle audio/video calling.  In this exercise, we will modify an example company website to add a live Jabber-Guest click-to-video experience.


## Step 1: Load the Southbeach Bank site for live-editing

Embedding the Jabber Guest widget into a web page requires only placing an HTML `<iframe>` element on the page with a `src` attribute containing the Jabber Guest URL - or simply opening a popup window with the URL.  Let's use Chrome's 'live-editing' features to modify the 'South Beach Bank' web site:

1. Click on the Southbeach Bank page link here: <a href="posts/files/collab-jg/example/southbeach.html" title="Southbeach Bank Site" target="\_blank">Southbeach Bank page</a> to open the site in a new browser tab

2. Right-click the 'Chat Now!' button and select 'Inspect Element', this will open the Chrome developer tools to the 'Elements' tab

3. Right-click on the highlighted `<input>` HTML code block and select 'Edit as HTML', this will open the code edit window
